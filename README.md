#### Technologies Used
* React.js: A library that makes it really easy for us to create web pages with advanced UI.
* Typescript: A language that lets you strictly define data types for all the variables and objects in your code and hence saves you from a lot of errors and makes it easy to scale your app in future.
* React Drag And Drop: You can think it of an abstract code that lets you easily define draggable and droppable objects in your app. Using this, you can easily implement drag and drop mechanism in your app. To use this in your project, simply write <q> npm i react-beautiful-dnd </q> and refer to the [docs](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd#:~:text=react%2Dbeautiful%2Ddnd%20is%20a,beautiful%20drag%20and%20drop%20experience.) to learn how use it in your app.
